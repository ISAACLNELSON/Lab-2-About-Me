        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Steven Miyauchi. I am a software developer that is 27 years old, and currently reside in Bellevue. I attended the University of Hawaii and Bellevue College for 4 years, focused in Business and Communications. I was a tennis coach for 6 years, ranked 13th in the nation as a player and helped design a decentralized application on the Ethereum Blockchain. My short term (within 5 years) goals are to become a software developer capable of leading a team of ambitious engineers to achieve any goal we set our minds to. My goal before this is to land a job at google or microsoft to gain credibility and build a positive reputation for myself in the coding industry.</p>
